permalink: result-multi-mapping

{% include template-h1.html %}

## Description
Extension methods can be used to execute a query and map the result to a strongly typed list with relations.

The relation can be either:
- [One to One](#example---query-multi-mapping-one-to-one)
- [One to Many](#example---query-multi-mapping-one-to-many)

These extension methods can be called from any object of type IDbConnection.
## Example - Query Multi-Mapping (One to One)
Query method can execute a query and map the result to a strongly typed list with a one to one relation.

{% include template-example.html %} {% highlight csharp %}
string sql = "SELECT * FROM Invoice AS A INNER JOIN InvoiceDetail AS B ON A.InvoiceID = B.InvoiceID;";

using (var connection = My.ConnectionFactory())
{
    connection.Open();

    var invoices = connection.Query<Invoice, InvoiceDetail, Invoice>(
            sql,
            (invoice, invoiceDetail) =>
            {
                invoice.InvoiceDetail = invoiceDetail;
                return invoice;
            },
            splitOn: "InvoiceID")
        .Distinct()
        .ToList();
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Example - Query Multi-Mapping (One to Many)
Query method can execute a query and map the result to a strongly typed list with a one to many relations.

{% include template-example.html %} {% highlight csharp %}
string sql = "SELECT * FROM Orders AS A INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS B ON A.OrderID = B.OrderID;";

using (var connection = new SqlCeConnection("Data Source=SqlCe_W3Schools.sdf"))
{
    connection.Open();
    
    var orderDictionary = new Dictionary<int, Order>();
    
    var list = connection.Query<Order, OrderDetail, Order>(
        sql,
        (order, orderDetail) =>
        {
          	Order orderEntry;
          
          	if (!orderDictionary.TryGetValue(order.OrderID, out orderEntry))
          	{
              	orderEntry = order;
              	orderEntry.OrderDetails = new List<OrderDetail>();
              	orderDictionary.Add(orderEntry.OrderID, orderEntry);
          	}
        
          	orderEntry.OrderDetails.Add(orderDetail);
          	return orderEntry;
        },
        splitOn: "OrderID")
    .Distinct()
    .ToList();
    
    Console.WriteLine(list.Count);
}
